## Introduction :
Brushless DC motors operate on the same principle of magnetic attraction and repulsion as brush motors, 
but they are constructed somewhat differently. Instead of a mechanical commutator and brushes, the magnetic
field of the stator is rotated by using electronic commutation. This requires the use of active control electronics.

## ~Tasks:
**I created a simple circuit powered by a DC motor,and I wrote a simple **algorithm** that changes the speed of this motor.**
